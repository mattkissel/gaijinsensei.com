**Goals**

Students have to read clues and figure out some riddles. 

**Materials** 

You can use one of two riddles:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Einstein Riddle</strong>
<ul>
<li><a href="/worksheets/einstein-riddle-worksheet">Einstein Riddle Worksheet & Answer Key</a></li>

<li><a href="/worksheets/einstein-riddle-worksheet/einstein-riddle-hints">Einstein Riddle Clues and Clue Order</a></li>

</ul>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Matt’s Riddle</strong>
<ul>

<li><a href="/worksheets/matt-riddle-worksheet/">Matt’s Riddle Chart and Answer Key</a></li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Preparation**

Print the respective riddle and familiarize yourself with how to solve it. Depending on the level of your students you may have to help them a lot.

**Procedure**



1. You could start your warm up with a talk about comparatives if you’re doing the Matt Riddle or something to get them thinking like [odd one out TO_LINK](#odd-one-out-13) or just list off some [riddles TO_LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a86N8Mp6jle7bwCrJerBopDfqeOarrAfSGLfUdPB5NY/edit)
2. Introduce the new words and phrases they will need to know to do the puzzles.
3. Hand out the riddle clues and charts and explain the instructions.
    *  You can do groups and split the clues between students (3-4 clues per student) so they have to read the clues to each other to practice listening. 
4. As students work, walk around the room and help them with the tricky parts.

**Homework**

The Einstein Riddle is sometimes a bit hard, so I let students finish it for homework. If they bring it in later I’ll give them a prize.
