**Goals**

Have students get to know each other by asking simple questions and playing bingo.

**Materials**



* [Introduction Bingo Sheets](../worksheets/introduction-bingo-worksheets)  (1 per person)
* Prizes (Candy or something for the winner)

**Preparation**

No real prep other than preparing the worksheets.

**Procedure**



1. Hand out the sheets and read students the instructions. Tell them you're the types of questions you're going to be using (Have you, do you, and are you). Have students quietly read the words in the squares on the bingo sheet and raise their hands to ask for the meaning of any words they don't know.  
2. Ask a few example questions to students or teachers so that students get an idea of how the game is played. If someone answers no to a question, move on. If someone answers "yes" have them write their name in the bingo square.
3. Students can begin the game and have to walk around the room asking each other questions. Once they have a bingo they can come to the teacher and receive their prize.

**Recurrent Events**

*Have you ____?* and *do you ____?* Questions. Also *Are you ____?* if using the non-simple version.

**(New)Vocabulary** 

Some of the bingo sheets have difficult words, have students read the sheets before starting to identify difficult words. They are different depending on the chosen sheet, some have "cousin", or "Vermont"	

**Homework**  
None

**Variations & Tips**

* I usually have a requirement of getting at least one teacher's name signed on the sheet to make sure students are being diligent.
* You can have students get more than one bingo if they are too fast with getting their bingos.
* You don't need to always make a sheet for bingo. If you want to review vocab just have students draw a grid on paper and fill it in with the current vocab.
* Many students won't be willing to say that they don't understand something so I usually review the bingo squares in the beginning (at the very least I review the hard ones).
