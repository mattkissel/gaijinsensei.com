## Goal

To make sure students can use at least 8 different greetings and 5 different farewells. 

## Materials



* [Greetings and Farewells Worksheet](../worksheets/greetings-and-farewells-worksheets/)(w/ [Greetings Dialogues](../worksheets/greetings-and-farewells-worksheets/) on the back)
* Blackboard

## Procedure

**Introduction**

Prompt students for different ways to say hello or goodbye, write them down and add some more from the handout. Have students repeat after the teacher, and give them a few minutes to think about the meanings. After, prompt the students for the meaning and give them the correct meaning. 

**Worksheet**

Pass out the greeting worksheet, with the dialogues. Have them fill in the blanks to practice the meanings. Don’t use dictionaries and encourage students to talk to each other about the meanings. Tell students there are many meanings but to write only one meaning in each box (e.g. for “Hello, yo, what’s up, hey, hi” the meaning can just be おっす or こんにちは).  Afterwards go over the answers, there can be many answers so be sure to get a few for each greeting.

**Practice game**

For a quick review, have all the students stand up and one by one hit them with a greeting or a farewell. If they respond correctly they can sit down, they aren’t allowed to use the same greeting or farewell as the teacher. * Note: To save time, instead of one by one (especially in classes with 20 or more) you can do this in a [criss-cross](criss-cross.md) format.*

**For example:**

|                                    |   |                                             |
|------------------------------------|---|---------------------------------------------|
| Teacher: How’s it going?           |   | Teacher: Goodbye!                           |
| Student:  Good, and you?           |   | Student: Goodbye!                           |
| **Correct**, the student can sit down. |   | **Incorrect**, the student should keep standing |
|                                    |   |                                             |
| Teacher:  See you later.           |   | Teacher: What’s new?                        |
| Student:  Take it easy.            |   | Student: Hello.                             |
| **Correct**, the student can sit down. |   | **Incorrect**, the student should keep standing |
|                                    |   |                                             |
| Teacher:  Hello                    |   | Teacher: Good afternoon!                    |
| Student:  Hey                      |   | Student: Have a nice day!                   |
| **Correct**, the student can sit down  |   | **Incorrect**, the student should keep standing |

**Dialogue**

Using the dialogues on the back of the worksheet have students repeat the first dialogue after the teacher.  Don’t read the second one as it’s a little harder. Students should pair up and practice the dialogue. Students should try to memorize and present it in front of the class. If there’s time you can have a few groups present. If not, tell all the students to memorize their dialogues for next class. Any groups that want a challenge can do the second dialogue.
