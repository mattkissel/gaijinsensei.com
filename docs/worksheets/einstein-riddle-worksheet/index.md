### Solution

Step 1: C8. House 3=chocolate (1 solved)

Step 2: C9. House 1=Dr (+1      2 solved)

Step 3: C14. The doctor’s neighbor lives in the blue house. Dr has only one neighbor, so 		House 2=blue (+1       3 solved)

Step 4: C4,5. The green house is to the left of the white house, green=natto. Since H2 is blue, the green house 	is either H3 or H4. H3 resident likes chocolate, not natto, so House 4=green, natto and House 5=white (+3      6 solved)

Step 5: C1. Designer=red. Only H1 and H3 have unassigned colors, and H1 is the dr, so House 

3=designer, red. By process of elimination, House 1=yellow (+3      9 solved)

Step 6: C7. yellow=hiking=House 1 (+1      10 solved)

Step 7: C11. Horses are next door to hiking. Hiking=H1 and has only 1 neighbor, so House

 2=horses (+1      11 solved)

Step 8: C2, 3, 12, 13. Farmer=pizza(3), can only be H2 or H5. Strawberries=drawing (12), can only be H2 or H5. Strawberries, comics cannot be farmer, doctor, designer, or DJ (13, he likes horseback riding). So, strawberries=comics=policeman=dogs (2). All houses except H5 have another category accounted for, so House 5=strawberries, comics, policeman, dogs. Farmer=pizza, and must now be House 2. House 2=farmer, pizza. Through elimination, House 4=DJ (and horseback riding). Again, through elimination, House 1=ramen.  (+9    20 solved)

Step 9: C15 Ramen is H1 and has only 1 neighbor, so House 2=karaoke. Through elimination, House 3=skateboarding. (+2    22 solved)

Step 10: C6. Skateboarding=turtle=House 3 (+1     23 solved)

Step 11: C10. karaoke is next door to cats, House 1=cats. Through elimination, House 4=fish  (+2    FINISH)
