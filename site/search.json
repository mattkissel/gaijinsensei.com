In my experience, this is almost all classrooms in Japan.</p> <p>Procedure Criss-cross is the golden standard of warm-up games. </p> <p>Students all stand up and the teacher asks them a series of questions (you can use this list ADD_LINK). The students can raise their hands and attempt to answer. If they are correct they can choose \"row\", \"column\"  and just me\".  If \"row\", all the students in the row of the answering student sit down. If \"column\",  the column sits down, if \"just me\" only the answering student sits down. </p> <p>For the first time you play, write down \"column\", \"row\" and \"just me\" on the board and practice pronunciation. In Japan, you can use O and X to represent right and wrong. Use O next to all three (row, column and just me) to indicate if they are correct they have a choice. Use X next to just me to show that even if they are wrong they can sit down.</p> <p>Vocabulary </p> English Japanese column 縦　（たて） row 横 （よこ） just me 私だけ <p>Evaluation None</p> <p>Variations &amp; Tips</p> <ul> <li>If nobody tries to answer within ten seconds I usually make a row or column stand up then begin to countdown again.</li> <li>Because students often don't say \"I don't understand\" or \"I don't know\".

Have them fill in the blanks to practice the meanings. Don’t use dictionaries and encourage students to talk to each other about the meanings. Tell students there are many meanings but to write only one meaning in each box (e.g. for “Hello, yo, what’s up, hey, hi” the meaning can just be おっす or こんにちは).  Afterwards go over the answers, there can be many answers so be sure to get a few for each greeting.</p> <p>Practice game</p> <p>For a quick review, have all the students stand up and one by one hit them with a greeting or a farewell. If they respond correctly they can sit down, they aren’t allowed to use the same greeting or farewell as the teacher. * Note: To save time, instead of one by one (especially in classes with 20 or more) you can do this in a criss-cross format.*</p> <p>For example:</p> Teacher: How’s it going? Teacher: Goodbye! Student:  Good, and you? Student: Goodbye! Correct, the student can sit down. Incorrect, the student should keep standing Teacher:  See you later. Teacher: What’s new? Student:  Take it easy. Student: Hello. Correct, the student can sit down. Incorrect, the student should keep standing Teacher:  Hello Teacher: Good afternoon! Student:  Hey Student: Have a nice day! Correct, the student can sit down Incorrect, the student should keep standing <p>Dialogue</p> <p>Using the dialogues on the back of the worksheet have students repeat the first dialogue after the teacher.  Don’t read the second one as it’s a little harder. Students should pair up and practice the dialogue. Students should try to memorize and present it in front of the class. If there’s time you can have a few groups present. If not, tell all the students to memorize their dialogues for next class.
